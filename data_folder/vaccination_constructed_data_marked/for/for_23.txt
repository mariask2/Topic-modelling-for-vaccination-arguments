You have to trust the large body of research, that despite many studies, there is no study that has been able to find a link between the MMR vaccination. I thought my flu was vaccine reactions, for instance, since I got the flu just after vaccination, but I realised it was a normal flu. It is easy to incorrectly make the connection between the jab and what happends after, although they just co-occur in time.

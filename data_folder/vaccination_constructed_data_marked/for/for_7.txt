The first vaccinations against small pox were based on inoculation of the actual small pox virus, before they had came up with the idea to use the cow pox virus instead. So early problems related to small pox vaccination are not relevant to small pox vaccination in the 20th century. That's a red herring strategy to argument against very early versions of the small pox vaccination.
